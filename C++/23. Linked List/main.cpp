// Linked List - a sequence of data structures nodes; each node containing data and a pointer to its successor node, serving as a link. The last node in the list
//               has its successor pointer set to NULL. The node at the beginning is called 'head of the list', and its just a pointer to a node without data.
//               The entire list is identified by the pointer to the first node, the pointer is called the head. The list head may have the address of the first node,
//               or may be NULL. The nodes of a linked list are usually dynamically allocated. Nodes can be added or removed from the linked list during execution.
//               Addition or removal of nodes can take place at beginning, middle or, end of the list
